### Undergraduate summer research projects for 2025

I will consider requests to apply for a <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/awards-and-grants/undergraduate-summer-bursaries">RAS Undergraduate Summer Bursary</a> received by January 24th 2025. Other funding routes are available, including through some Durham colleges ([Collingwood](https://www.durham.ac.uk/colleges-and-student-experience/colleges/collingwood/life/student-enrichment/), for example). I may also be able to offer a funded summer studentship. Please [get in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}) early (preferably by mid January 2025) to discuss possibilities if interested!
