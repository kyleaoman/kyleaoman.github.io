### PhD student for Autumn 2025 entry

I am open to taking on a scholarship-funded PhD student to begin in Autumn 2025 and will consider supporting nominations to the [DDS, CSC, Bell-Burnell](https://astro.dur.ac.uk/index.php?content=CEA/Postgraduate/Postgraduate) and other schemes. Most of these expect the candidate to formulate their own research proposal in consultation with a prospective supervisor. I recommend [getting in touch](mailto:{{ site.email }}") by November 15th 2024 for full consideration.
