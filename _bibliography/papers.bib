     abstract = "{In the conventional approach to decomposing a rotation curve into a set
        of contributions from mass model components, the measurements of
        the rotation curve at different radii are taken to be
        independent. It is clear, however, that radial correlations are
        present in such data, for instance (but not only) because the
        orbital speed depends on the mass distribution at all (or,
        minimally, inner) radii. We adopt a very simple parametric form
        for a covariance matrix and constrain its parameters using
        Gaussian process regression. Applied to the rotation curve of
        the Milky Way, this suggests the presence of correlations
        between neighbouring rotation curve points with amplitudes of
        < 10 km s<sup>-1</sup> over length scales of 1.5-2.5 kpc regardless of
        the assumed dark halo component. We show that accounting for
        such covariance can result in a
        $\sim$ 50 per cent lower total mass
        estimate for the Milky Way than when it is neglected, and that
        the uncertainty in model parameters increases such that it seems
        more representative of the uncertainty in the rotation curve
        measurement. The statistical uncertainty associated with the
        covariance is comparable to or exceeds the total systematic
        uncertainty budget. Our findings motivate including more
        detailed treatment of rotation curve covariance in future
        analyses.}",

        'typical' star-forming discs at z $\sim$ 1.5, being located within the
        star-forming main sequence and stellar mass-size relation with
        stellar masses 9.5 ≤ log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) ≤ 11.5.
	We use the spatially resolved Hα emission to extract
	individual rotation
        curves out to 4 times the effective radius, on average, or
        $\sim$ 10-15 kpc. Most rotation curves
        are flat or rising between three and six disc scale radii. Only
        three objects with dispersion-dominated dynamics
        (v<sub>rot</sub>/σ<sub>0</sub> $\sim$ 0.2)
        have declining outer
        rotation curves at more than 5σ

        the nine rotation-dominated discs with
        v<sub>rot</sub>/σ<sub>0</sub> ≥ 1.5

	at the effective radius, similar to local discs.
        Together with previous observations of star-forming galaxies at

        matter fraction with increasing stellar mass and stellar mass
        surface density at the effective radius. Measurements of

        observations up to log(M<sub>★</sub> R<sub>eff</sub><sup>-2</sup>

        dark matter fraction of galaxies with higher mass surface
        densities by a factor of $\sim$ 3. We
        conclude that the dynamics of typical rotationally-supported
        discs at z $\sim$ 1.5 is dominated by
        dark matter from effective radius scales, in broad agreement
        with cosmological models. The tension with observations at high
        stellar mass surface density suggests that the prescriptions for
        baryonic processes occurring in the most massive galaxies (such
        as bulge growth and quenching) need to be reassessed.}",

        discs; (ii) the finite thickness of gaseous discs, which leads
        to overlap of different radii in projection; and (iii)
        departures from dynamical equilibrium. Dwarfs with dark matter
        cusps often appear to have a core, whilst the inverse error is
        less common. These effects naturally reproduce an observed trend
        which other models struggle to explain: late-type dwarfs with
        more steeply rising rotation curves appear to be dark matter-
        dominated in the inner regions, whereas the opposite seems to
        hold in galaxies with core-like rotation curves. We conclude

        Fisher relation. The new observations, at a spatial resolution
        $\sim$ 2.5 times higher than before,
        reveal a regular HI disc rotating at about 23 km s<sup>-1</sup>. Our

        be explained almost entirely by the baryonic mass distribution
        alone. We show that a standard cold dark matter halo that
        follows the concentration-halo mass relation fails to reproduce
        the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large margin. Only a
        halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low

        - based on 21,827 sources from the final 7000 deg<sup>2</sup>
        data release of the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey.
        The number density of sources as a function of their neutral
        hydrogen masses - the HI mass function (HIMF) - has
        previously been reported to have a significantly different low-
        mass slope and 'knee mass' in the two sky regions surveyed
        during ALFALFA. In contrast with this, we find that the shape of
        the HIWF in the same two sky regions is remarkably similar,
        consistent with being identical within the confidence intervals
        implied by the data (but the overall normalization differs). The
        spatial uniformity of the HIWF implies that it is likely a
        stable tracer of the mass function of dark matter haloes, in
        spite of the environmental processes to which the measured

        previously overlooked systematic error affecting the HIWF,
        which may plausibly see its low-velocity slope steepen by
        $\sim$ 40 per cent in analyses of

        almost entirely been shut down, but the exact mechanism that
        quenched these galaxies is still uncertain. Aims:
        By tracing the orbital and star formation histories of galaxies
        within the Coma cluster, we seek to understand the role of the
        high-density cluster environment in quenching these galaxies.
        Methods: We combine star formation histories
        extracted from high-signal-to-noise spectra of 11 early-type
        galaxies around the center of the Coma cluster with probability
        distributions for their orbital parameters obtained using an
        N-body simulation to connect their orbital and star formation
        histories. Results: We find that all 11 galaxies
        likely quenched near their first pericentric approach. Higher
        stellar mass galaxies
        (log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) >
        10) had formed a higher fraction of their stellar mass (more
        than $\sim$ 90\%) than their lower mass counterparts
        ($\sim$ 80-90\%) by the time they
        fell into the cluster (when they cross 2.5r<sub>vir</sub>). We find
        that the expected infall occurred around z $\sim$
        0.6, followed by the first pericentric passage
        $\sim$ 4 Gyr later. Galaxies in our sample formed a
        significant fraction of their stellar mass, up to 15\%, between
        infall and first pericenter, and had assembled more than
        $\sim$ 98\% of their cumulative stellar mass by
        first pericenter. Conclusions: Unlike previous
        low-redshift studies that suggest that star formation continues
        until about first apocenter or later, the high percentage of
        stellar mass already formed by first pericenter in our sample
        galaxies points to star formation ceasing within a gigayear
        after the first pericentric passage. We consider the possible
        physical mechanisms driving quenching and find that our results
        resemble the situation in clusters at z $\sim$ 1,
        where active stripping of gas (ram-pressure or tidally driven)
        seems to be required to quench satellites by their first
        pericentric passage. However, a larger sample will be required
        to conclusively account for the unknown fraction of preprocessed
        satellites in the Coma cluster.}",

        circumgalactic gaseous haloes. The observed behaviour is also
        expected in Λ-cold dark matter
        (ΛCDM) models where the galaxy-to-halo mass

        MICE, a ΛCDM simulation with hybrid halo
        occupation distribution modelling and abundance matching,
        reproduces the observed RAR but significantly differs from
        BAHAMAS, a hydrodynamical cosmological galaxy formation
        simulation. Our results are sensitive to the amount of
        circumgalactic gas; current observational constraints indicate
        that the resulting corrections are likely moderate. Measurements
        of the lensing RAR with future cosmological surveys (such as
        Euclid) will be able to further distinguish between MG and
        ΛCDM models if systematic uncertainties in
        the baryonic mass distribution around galaxies are reduced.}",

        located at $\sim$ r<sub>200  m</sub>; the strength and location
        of this feature depends on the recent mass accretion rate, in

        For SIDM dwarfs, the mass and density profiles are recovered

        outliers from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), as they
        rotate much slower than expected given their baryonic mass, and
        to have a baryon fraction similar to the cosmological mean. By

        baryon fractions of our UDGs may originate due to the fact that
        they have experienced weak stellar feedback, likely due to their
        low star formation rate surface densities, and as a result they
        did not eject significant amounts of gas out of their discs. At

        remarkably little scatter, implying that the dynamics of a
        system can be predicted simply by measuring its density profile
        as traced by e.g. stellar light or gas emission lines. Extending
        the relation to accelerations below those usually probed by
        practically observable kinematic tracers is challenging,
        especially once accounting for faintly emitting baryons, such as
        the putative warm-hot intergalactic medium, becomes important.
        We show that in the low-acceleration regime, the (inverted) RAR
        predicts an unphysical, declining enclosed baryonic mass profile

        of the luminous component ('baryons') in the rotation curve
        diversity problem. As in earlier work, we find that rotation
        curve shape correlates with baryonic surface density: high
        surface density galaxies have rapidly rising rotation curves
        consistent with cuspy cold dark matter haloes; slowly rising
        rotation curves (characteristic of galaxies with inner mass
        deficits or 'cores') occur only in low surface density galaxies.
        The correlation, however, seems too weak to be the main driver
        of the diversity. In addition, dwarf galaxies exhibit a clear
        trend, from 'cuspy' systems where baryons are unimportant in the
        inner mass budget to 'cored' galaxies where baryons actually
        dominate. This trend constrains the various scenarios proposed
        to explain the diversity, such as (I) baryonic inflows and
        outflows during galaxy formation; (II) dark matter self-
        interactions; (III) variations in the baryonic mass structure
        coupled to rotation velocities through the 'mass discrepancy-
        acceleration relation' (MDAR); or (IV) non-circular motions in
        gaseous discs. Together with analytical modelling and
        cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, our analysis shows that
        each of these scenarios has promising features, but none seems
        to fully account for the observed diversity. The MDAR, in
        particular, is inconsistent with the observed trend between
        rotation curve shape and baryonic importance; either the trend
        is caused by systematic errors in the data or the MDAR does not
        apply. The origin of the dwarf galaxy rotation curve diversity
        and its relation to the structure of cold dark matter haloes

        physically motivated models to the Gaia DR2 Galactic rotation
        curve and other data. Using various hydrodynamical simulations
        of MW-mass haloes, we show that the presence of baryons induces
        a contraction of the dark matter (DM) distribution in the inner
        regions, r ≲ 20 kpc. We provide an
        analytic expression that relates the baryonic distribution to
        the change in the DM halo profile. For our galaxy, the
        contraction increases the enclosed DM halo mass by factors of
        roughly 1.3, 2, and 4 at radial distances of 20, 8, and 1 kpc,
        respectively compared to an uncontracted halo. Ignoring this
        contraction results in systematic biases in the inferred halo
        mass and concentration. We provide a best-fitting contracted NFW
        halo model to the MW rotation curve that matches the data very
        well. The best-fit has a DM halo mass, M<sub>200</sub><sup>DM</sup>=0.97<sub>-0.19</sub><sup>+0.24</sup> × 10<sup>12</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, and
        concentration before baryon contraction of 9.4<sub>-2.6</sub><sup>+1.9</sup>,
        which lie close to the median halo mass-concentration relation

        of baryons in the simulations changes the picture because
        processes associated with the presence of a large galaxy in the
        halo can destroy subhaloes and substantially alter the mass
        function and velocity distribution of subhaloes. We compare the
        effect of galaxy formation on subhalo populations in two state-
        of-the-art sets of hydrodynamical Λcold
        dark matter (ΛCDM) simulations of Milky Way
        mass haloes, APOSTLE and AURIGA. We introduce a new method for
        tracking the orbits of subhaloes between simulation snapshots

        centre of the halo. Relative to a dark matter-only simulation,
        the abundance of subhaloes in APOSTLE is reduced by 50 per cent
        near the centre and by 10 per cent within r<sub>200</sub>. In AURIGA,
        the corresponding numbers are 80 per cent and 40 per cent. The
        velocity distributions of subhaloes are also affected by the
        presence of the galaxy, much more so in AURIGA than in APOSTLE.
        The differences on subhalo properties in the two simulations can
        be traced back to the mass of the central galaxies, which in
        AURIGA are typically twice as massive as those in APOSTLE. We
        show that some of the results from previous studies are

        likely only on its second pericentric passage, and thus was

        the ends of the stream. The luminosity, length, width, and

        known globulars in the Galaxy. This result suggests the

        poor population. In this work we discuss mechanisms that lead to
        the formation of two spatially segregated metallicity
        populations. Using a set of high-resolution hydrodynamical
        simulations of Local Group-like environments, we select a sample

        10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, that exhibit
        bimodality in their metallicity distributions. Among those, we
        identify a subsample with a strong spatial segregation in the
        two populations. We find three distinct mechanisms for their
        formation. In field dwarfs and in a small fraction of
        satellites, a merger causes the metal-poor stars to migrate to
        larger radii and encourages the available gas to sink to the
        centre of the dwarf. Most of the gas is subsequently blown out
        of the halo through star formation feedback, but the remaining
        gas is consumed in the formation of a metal-rich population. In
        the exclusive case of satellites that have retained some of
        their gas at infall, it is the compression of this gas by ram
        pressure near pericentre that triggers the formation of metal-
        rich stars, whilst simultaneously preventing star formation at
        larger radii through stripping. Additionally, in a small number
        of field and satellite dwarfs, interactions with gaseous
        filaments and other galaxies can result in the formation of a
        metal-rich population. Regardless of the formation mechanism, a

        suggested that this conflict could be resolved by fluctuations
        in the inner gravitational potential caused by the periodic
        removal of gas following bursts of star formation. Earlier work
        has suggested that core formation requires a bursty and extended

        formation at any mass or any correlation between the inner slope
        of the DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH.
        APOSTLE and AURIGA dwarfs display a similar diversity in their

        in both simulations are DM-dominated on all resolved scales at

        significantly the central density profiles of their haloes. We
        conclude that recurrent bursts of star formation are not

        galaxy stellar mass: faint field dwarfs (10<sup>5</sup> <
        M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub> < 10<sup>6</sup>) have, on
        average, steadily declining SFHs, whereas brighter dwarfs
        (10<sup>7</sup> < M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub> <
        10<sup>9</sup>) show the opposite trend. Intermediate-mass dwarfs
        have roughly constant SFHs. Satellites exhibit similar average
        trends, but with substantially suppressed star formation in the
        most recent $\sim$ 5 Gyr, likely as a result of gas
        loss due to tidal and ram-pressure stripping after entering the
        haloes of their primaries. These simple mass and environmental
        trends are in good agreement with the derived SFHs of Local
        Group (LG) dwarfs whose photometry reaches the oldest main-
        sequence turn-off. SFHs of galaxies with less deep data show
        deviations from these trends, but this may be explained, at
        least in part, by the large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter, the
        limited sample size, and the large uncertainties of the inferred
        SFHs. Confirming the predicted mass and environmental trends
        will require deeper photometric data than currently available,
        especially for isolated dwarfs.}",

        spectra within the SAMI field of view. These
        Hδ-strong (HDS) galaxies (HDSGs)
        are rare, making up only $\sim$ 2\% (25/1220) of
        galaxies with stellar mass log(M<sub>★</sub>/M<sub>⊙</sub>) > 10. The HDSGs make up a
        significant fraction of nonpassive cluster galaxies (15\%;
        17/115) and a smaller fraction (2.0\%; 8/387) of the nonpassive
        population in low-density environments. The majority (9/17) of
        cluster HDSGs show evidence of star formation at their centers,
        with the HDS regions found in the outer parts of the galaxy.
        Conversely, the HDS signal is more evenly spread across the
        galaxy for the majority (6/8) of HDSGs in low-density
        environments and is often associated with emission lines that
        are not due to star formation. We investigate the location of
        the HDSGs in the clusters, finding that they are exclusively
        within 0.6R <sub>200</sub> of the cluster center and have a
        significantly higher velocity dispersion relative to the cluster
        population. Comparing their distribution in projected phase
        space to those derived from cosmological simulations indicates
        that the cluster HDSGs are consistent with an infalling
        population that has entered the central 0.5r<sub>200,3D</sub> cluster
        region within the last $\sim$ 1 Gyr. In the eight of
        nine cluster HDSGs with central star formation, the extent of
        star formation is consistent with that expected of outside-in

        hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large
        diversity of rotation curves for an individual galaxy at fixed
        inclination, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The
        diversity is driven by non-circular motions in the gas; in
        particular, by strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal
        velocities that the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account
        for and that are difficult to detect in model residuals. Large
        misestimates of the circular velocity arise when the kinematic
        major axis coincides with the extrema of the fluctuation
        pattern, in some cases mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-
        scale density `cores', when none are actually present. The
        thickness of APOSTLE discs compounds this effect: more slowly
        rotating extra-planar gas systematically reduces the average
        line-of-sight speeds. The recovered rotation curves thus tend to

        such as DDO 47 and DDO 87, where the model residuals suggest
        that such motions might have affected estimates of the inner
        circular velocities. Although residuals from tilted-ring models
        in the simulations appear larger than in observed galaxies, our

        with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes
        with maximum circular velocities V<sub>max</sub> < 20-30 km s<sup>-1</sup>.
        Dark-matter-dominated dwarfs should therefore have
        characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are
        small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular
        velocity curve (i.e. half-mass radii, r<sub>1/2</sub>

        disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to
        probe their halo V<sub>max</sub> but their characteristic velocities
        are well below 20 km s<sup>-1</sup>. These 'cold faint giants' (an

        satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the

        minimum expected for isolated dwarfs. In many cases, the

        centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by the
        feedback of young stars; which links the star formation,
        enrichment, and equilibration time-scales, inducing radial and
        vertical gradients in the gaseous disc and its descendent stars.
        The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little after birth and

     abstract = "{The cosmological constant + cold dark matter (ΛCDM) theory is the 'standard model' of cosmology. Encoded in it are extremely accurate descriptions of the large scale structure of the Universe, despite a very limited number of degrees of freedom. The model struggles, however, to explain some measurements on galactic and smaller scales. The shape of the dark matter distribution toward the centres of galaxies is predicted to be steeply increasing in density ('cuspy') by the theory, yet observations of the rotation curves of some galaxies suggest that it instead reaches a central density plateau (a 'core'). This discrepancy is termed the 'cusp-core problem'. I propose a new way of quantifying this problem as a diversity in the central mass content of galaxies. This characterization does not distinguish between dark and ordinary ('baryonic') matter, but the apparent problem is so severe that the signature of the cusp-core discrepancy is still obvious. By formulating the problem in this way, several uncertain modelling steps are effectively removed from the discussion, allowing for a more narrowly focussed examination of remaining steps in the analysis. My subsequent comparison of recent results from galaxy formation simulations and observed galaxies in the space of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) reveals some galaxies with an apparent anomalously low dark matter content not only in the centre, but out to the largest measurable radii. These objects are very difficult to explain within the ΛCDM framework; the most plausible interpretation which emerges is that the effect of systematic uncertainties in modelling the kinematics in these galaxies – particularly in the estimate of their inclinations – has been substantially underestimated. This motivates a re-examination of rotation curve measurement methods. I use a collection of simulated galaxies to demonstrate that, when these are synthetically 'observed' and modelled analogously to real galaxies, non-circular motions present in the gas discs give the appearance of cores, even though all of the simulated galaxies have central cusps. The errors are large enough to reproduce the full width of the observed scatter in rotation curve shapes. Provided the simulations produce sufficiently faithful models of real galaxies, these modelling errors could constitute a solution to the cusp-core problem within the ΛCDM paradigm. Regardless, the kinematic models must be better understood before drawing any strong cosmological conclusions.}",

        often used to measure dynamical masses. Recently, several
        analytical relationships between the stellar line-of-sight
        velocity dispersion, the projected (2D) or deprojected (3D)
        half-light radius and the total mass enclosed within the half-
        light radius, relying on the spherical Jeans equation, have been
        proposed. Here, we use the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical
        simulations of the Local Group to test the validity and accuracy
        of such mass estimators for both dispersion and rotation-
        supported galaxies, for field and satellite galaxies, and for
        galaxies of varying masses, shapes and velocity dispersion
        anisotropies. We find that the mass estimators of Walker et al.
        and Wolf et al. are able to recover the masses of dispersion-
        dominated systems with little systematic bias, but with a
        1σ scatter of 25 and 23 per cent,
        respectively. The error on the estimated mass is dominated by
        the impact of the 3D shape of the stellar mass distribution,
        which is difficult to constrain observationally. This intrinsic
        scatter becomes the dominant source of uncertainty in the masses
        estimated for galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
        satellites of the Milky Way, where the observational errors in
        their sizes and velocity dispersions are small. Such scatter may
        also affect the inner density slopes of dSphs derived from
        multiple stellar populations, relaxing the significance with
        which Navarro-Frenk-White profiles may be excluded, depending on
        the degree to which the relevant properties of the different
        stellar populations are correlated. Finally, we derive a new
        optimal mass estimator that removes the residual biases and
        achieves a statistically significant reduction in the scatter to
        20 per cent overall for dispersion-dominated galaxies, allowing
        more precise and accurate mass estimates.}",

        galaxy formation models. It is steeper than the M ∝ V<sup>3</sup> scaling relating halo virial
        masses and circular velocities and its zero-point implies that
        galaxies comprise a very small fraction of available baryons.
        Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may, in principle, be
        explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness
        of the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter
        expected from such a vigorous feedback mechanism. We use the
        APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that the BTF relation is well
        reproduced in Λcold dark matter (CDM)
        simulations that match the size and number of galaxies as a
        function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy rotation
        velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the
        steep velocity-mass dependence results from the decline in
        galaxy formation efficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to
        reconcile the CDM halo mass function with the galaxy luminosity

        designed to isolate the environmental effect on the star

        `pre-processing' in previous group hosts. We find that quenching

        (>10<sup>13</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) clusters is

        within a Gyr of their first pericentric passage. There is little

        correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo mass,
        dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a

        mass and, consequently, on its asymptotic maximum circular

        constraint, having baryonic masses up to 10 times higher than
        expected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating
        at only half the speed expected for their mass. Taking the data

        difficult to reconcile with the small relative tangential

        Halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses a

        shape of the circular velocity profiles of simulated galaxies
        varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, but shows
        remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.
        This is especially true for low-mass dark-matter-dominated
        systems, reflecting the expected similarity of the underlying
        CDM haloes. This is at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, which
        show a large diversity of rotation curve shapes, even at fixed

        agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are

        galaxies represent an area of ongoing research, but the
        projected nature of observed coordinates makes separating
        different populations of satellites (with different processes at
        work) difficult. The present-day phase space coordinates of a
        satellite galaxy carry information about its orbital history,
        which can then be compared to its star formation history (SFH).
        This is expected to reveal both a trigger time and timescale for
        environmental quenching. Finally, this can be related back to
        the physical process(es) regulating star formation in high
        density environments. We use merger trees from the MultiDark Run
        1 N-body simulation to compile a catalogue of satellite orbits
        in cluster environments. We parameterize the orbital history by
        the time since crossing within 2.5 virial radii of the cluster
        centre and use our catalogue to estimate the probability density
        over a range of this parameter given a set of projected phase
        space coordinates. We show that different populations of
        satellite haloes occupy (semi-)distinct regions of (projected)
        phase space. We generalize this result by producing a
        probability distribution function (PDF) of possible infall times
        at every point in projected phase space. We apply our method to
        determining the infall time PDFs of a large sample of observed
        cluster satellite candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
        We use galaxy colour as a proxy for SFH and model the
        distribution of satellite galaxy colours as two gaussian
        populations. We derive a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method to
        obtain the colour distribution as a function of the time since
        infall into the cluster environment. Our implementation of this
        method is still being tuned, but we use a second simpler (but
        much cruder) method to obtain an estimate of the evolution of
        the colour distribution. Our results are suggestive of a
        quenching process that begins within perhaps ±1
        Gyr of virial radius crossing and which slows after pericentric
        passage. We stress that results obtained with this second method
        come with important caveats.}",

     abstract = "{Physical processes regulating star formation in satellite galaxies
        represent an area of ongoing research, but the projected nature
        of observed coordinates makes separating different populations
        of satellites (with different processes at work) difficult. The
        orbital history of a satellite galaxy leads to its present-day
        phase space coordinates; we can also work backwards and use
        these coordinates to statistically infer information about the
        orbital history. We use merger trees from the MultiDark Run 1
        N-body simulation to compile a catalogue of the orbits of
        satellite haloes in cluster environments. We parametrize the
        orbital history by the time since crossing within 2.5 r<sub>vir</sub>
        of the cluster centre and use our catalogue to estimate the
        probability density over a range of this parameter given a set
        of present-day projected (i.e. observable) phase space
        coordinates. We show that different populations of satellite
        haloes, e.g. infalling, backsplash and virialized, occupy
        distinct regions of phase space and semidistinct regions of
        projected phase space. This will allow us to probabilistically
        determine the time since infall of a large sample of observed
        satellite galaxies, and ultimately to study the effect of
        orbital history on star formation history (the topic of a future
        paper). We test the accuracy of our method and find that we can
        reliably recover this time within ±2.58 Gyr in
        68 per cent of cases by using all available phase space
        coordinate information, compared to ±2.64 Gyr
        using only position coordinates and ±3.10 Gyr
        guessing `blindly', i.e. using no coordinate information, but
        with knowledge of the overall distribution of infall times. In
        some regions of phase space, the accuracy of the infall time
        estimate improves to ±1.85 Gyr. Although we
        focus on time since infall, our method is easily generalizable
        to other orbital parameters (e.g. pericentric distance and
        time).}",
